# Sockets
practicing sockets in python

Using two terminals, start the socket_server.py script and it should look like its hanging. 
Afterwards, start th socket_client.py script and it should say 'say something!' and appear to hang as well. 
Type what you want to send to the server and press enter. 
The socket_server.py will print to screen who connected to them (in IP:port form) as well as the message you just sent!
